                      other bureaucracy, but program offered courses in real estate, asset management entrepreneurship,
                      and wealth creation. 98% students gave positive reviews while studying, however some of these
                      ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25

                      building and boosted it from three-star to four-star hotel (I called it "the Mona Lisa" and sold

                    <p><em>1985</em></p>
                    <p>I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned it into a private club.You can join if
                      you pay $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to
                      be rich). That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager,
                      because she is another Trump!</p>

                    <p>I purchased New Jersey Generals, an American football team. I changed team's play schedule and
                      filed an antitrust lawsuit against United States Football League, so NJG are not doing so good
                      now, but back then they were great!</p>

                    <p>Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan, I payed a crew of undocumented Polish
                      workers to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features. All this to
                      make architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is "the most
                      pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years". At the same time I also
                      started a repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the work in three months
                      for $1.95 million, which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!</p>
